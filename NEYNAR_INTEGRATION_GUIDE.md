# Neynar API Integration Guide for CastKPR

## Overview

I've enhanced your CastKPR system with comprehensive Neynar API integration, focusing on two key areas:

1. **User Quality Scores** - Analyze and filter content based on author reputation
2. **Intelligent Cast Search** - Find similar casts using advanced search algorithms

This integration makes @cstkpr significantly smarter by leveraging Farcaster's network data and quality signals.

## 🎯 Enhanced @cstkpr Intelligence

### What's New in Opinion Generation

When someone asks "@cstkpr what's your opinion?", the bot now:

1. **Extracts key topics** from the cast content
2. **Searches local database** for related saved casts
3. **🆕 Searches Neynar API** for similar casts across Farcaster
4. **Analyzes user quality** of the original author
5. **Compares quality patterns** across similar discussions
6. **Forms nuanced opinions** based on comprehensive data

### Example Enhanced Response

```
🧠 Analysis: This cast has a positive sentiment with an analytical tone.

👤 Author Quality: @username has a high Neynar score (0.82), ranking in the top ~27.5k accounts. This suggests reliable, quality content creation and positive community interactions. The Neynar score reflects account quality and value-added contributions to the Farcaster network.

I believe this cast effectively explains the importance of AI ethics, and demonstrates the need for better frameworks, thoughtful regulation, and broader community involvement.

Across 12 similar casts in the Farcaster network, 67% come from high-quality authors (Neynar score 0.7+). The average author quality score is 0.74, indicating strong community credibility around this topic. 5 similar discussions happened in the past week, suggesting moderate current relevance.

📊 Confidence: 87% | Sources: 3 saved casts + 12 similar casts via Neynar + User quality analysis
```

## 🔍 Neynar Search API Integration

### Search Capabilities

The new `findSimilarCastsViaAPI()` method uses multiple search strategies:

#### 1. **Semantic Search**
```typescript
// Searches for meaning, not just keywords
query: "AI agents becoming sophisticated social networks future"
mode: "semantic"
```

#### 2. **Topic-Based Search** 
```typescript
// Uses OR operators for topic discovery
query: "ai | artificial-intelligence | machine-learning"
mode: "hybrid" 
```

#### 3. **Phrase Matching**
```typescript
// Exact phrase searches with quotes
query: "\"AI ethics framework\""
mode: "literal"
```

#### 4. **Fuzzy Matching**
```typescript
// Handles typos and variations
query: "artificial~2 + intelligence~2"
mode: "hybrid"
```

#### 5. **Context-Aware Queries**
```typescript
// For questions, find similar questions
query: "AI ethics + (\"what\" | \"how\" | \"why\" | \"?\")"

// For announcements, find similar launches  
query: "AI framework + (\"announce\" | \"launch\" | \"release\")"
```

### Quality-Enhanced Ranking

Results are ranked by:
- **Relevance Score (70%)**: Topic overlap, content similarity, engagement
- **Neynar Quality Score (30%)**: Author reputation and credibility
- **Recency Bonus**: Newer content gets preference
- **Engagement Quality**: Likes and recasts boost relevance

## 📊 User Quality Analysis

### Quality Tiers Breakdown

```typescript
// Automatic classification based on Neynar scores
if (score >= 0.9) tier = 'high'      // Top ~2.5k accounts (exceptional)
else if (score >= 0.7) tier = 'high' // Top ~27.5k accounts (high quality)  
else if (score >= 0.5) tier = 'medium' // Recommended threshold (balanced)
else if (score >= 0.3) tier = 'medium' // Below average (acceptable)
else tier = 'low' // Low quality/potential spam
```

### Quality Insights Generated

For each analyzed cast, the system provides:

- **Score Context**: "Ranking in top ~27.5k accounts"
- **Quality Explanation**: What the score means for content reliability
- **Network Significance**: How it reflects contribution value
- **Community Patterns**: Quality distribution in similar discussions
